# FreeRTOS - RTOS Programming

## Description

This project focuses on Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) programming using FreeRTOS. The primary goal is to understand how to work with FreeRTOS and implement real-time functionality.

## Project Structure

- The core code and implementation of FreeRTOS tasks, queues, and other real-time components can be found in the `FreeRTOS.c` file.
- Additionally, the project includes a `main.c` program.

### `FreeRTOS.c`

The `FreeRTOS.c` file contains the core code and implementation of the FreeRTOS components. It serves as the central part of the project, showcasing how to use FreeRTOS effectively.

### `main.c`

The `main.c` program performs a specific task:

#### Task: Latitude and Longitude Conversion

- Written in C, the `main.c` program converts latitude and longitude coordinates expressed in decimal degrees into degrees/minutes/seconds format. This functionality is useful for applications that require geospatial data processing.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Explore the `FreeRTOS.c` file for FreeRTOS implementation details.
2. Refer to the `main.c` program for latitude and longitude conversion.
3. Build and run the project according to your development environment and platform requirements.
